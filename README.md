## A MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORK FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM FLOW ESTIMATION, CHARACTERIZATION, AND PREDICTION

This repository presents an AI-driven machine learning framework for estimating, characterizing, and predicting public transportation system flows. Developed using real-world data from New York City and San Francisco subway systems, this framework aims to support resilient and adaptive public transit operations during both normal and disrupted conditions (e.g., pandemics).

## üîç Overview
The framework includes three core components:

1. **OD Flow Estimation**
   *Unsupervised origin-destination flow estimation for analyzing COVID-19 impact on public transport mobility*
   - A new methodology for analyzing COVID-19 impact on public transport mobility.
   - It includes a proposed unsupervised ML method to estimate public transport system OD flows from boarding-alighting data.
   - It includes a temporal-spatial analysis method to analyze OD flow changes before and during COVID-19.
   - The proposed methodology was implemented in analyzing COVID-19 impact in the New York City area.
   - The proposed methodology could support analyzing the impact of natural disasters on public transport mobility across time and space.

2. **Flow Characterization**
   *Modeling and Inferring Purposes of Public Transportation Trips for Human Need-Responsive Urban Mobility Efficiency*
   - Temporal-spatial analysis of COVID-19 impact on urban mobility from the lens of public transportation systems.
   - A new Bayesian-based method is proposed to model and infer public transportation trip purposes at the hourly, station level.
   - By integrating a gravity model for space-dependent trip purpose distributions and a temporal variation model, the method enables reliable PT trip purpose inference.
   - The proposed method is implemented in the New York City area with NYC subway data, revealing temporal and spatial variations in the COVID-19 impact on subway trip purposes, with severity differing by land-use characteristics and trip purpose types.
   - The proposed method could support analyzing the impact of large-scale natural disasters on urban mobility across time and space, aiding transportation agencies in designing more resilient services.

3. **Long-Range Flow Prediction**
   *Context-Aware Long-Range Transportation Flow Prediction for Supporting Urban Mobility Informatics*
   - Jointly model spatial, contextual, and temporal dynamics for flow prediction.
   - Propose a similarity-based shared dilated convolution method for spatial modeling.
   - Introduce a new multi-context embedding method for integrated contextual modeling.
   - Use attention-based transformer for effective long-range temporal modeling.
   - Outperform state-of-the-art method in long-range transportation flow prediction.
