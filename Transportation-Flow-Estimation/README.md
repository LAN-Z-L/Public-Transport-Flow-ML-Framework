## Unsupervised Origin-Destination Flow Estimation for Analyzing COVID-19 Impact on Public Transport Mobility

The outbreak of COVID-19 caused unprecedented disruptions to public transport services. As such, this paper proposes a methodology for analyzing COVID-19 impact on public transport mobility. The proposed methodology includes: (1) a new unsupervised machine learning (UML) method, which utilizes a decoder-encoder architecture and a flow property-based learning objective function, to estimate the origin-destination (OD) flows of public transport systems from boarding-alighting data; and (2) a temporal-spatial analysis method to analyze OD flow change before and during COVID-19 to unveil its impact on mobility across time and space. The validation of the UML method showed that it achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.836 when estimating OD flows using boarding-alighting data. Upon the successful validation, the proposed methodology was implemented to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the mobility of the New York City subway system. The implementation results indicate that (1) the rise in the number of weekly new COVID-19 cases intensified the impact on the public transport mobility, but not as strongly as public health interventions; and (2) the inflows to and outflows from the center of the city were more sensitive to the impact of COVID-19.

- **The implementation results showed that:**
  - **(1)** Although the overall impact of the pandemic was becoming contained as time went by, the rise of weekly new COVID-19 cases in an analysis timeframe led to an impact relatively more intensified than the previous timeframe, in terms of both impact magnitude and breadth. Yet, the intensified impact was still much more contained than the impact for the initial phase of the pandemic, when public health interventions such as ‚Äústay-at-home‚Äù orders were in place.
  - **(2)** The impact showed a radial pattern: the impact on the inflows to and outflows from the Manhattan neighborhood, the center of the city, became more contained when the overall impact got milder, and the impact became more intensified when the overall impact got severer.
